# Group 10 - Insurance Renewal Prediction App

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Insurance Renewal Prediction Web App** built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn** and **Python**.  
The app predicts whether a customer will **renew** their insurance policy based on demographic, behavioral and payment history features.



## Features

- Predict customer renewal probability using a trained **Random Forest model**.
- Interactive **Streamlit** web interface for:
  - Manual data entry
  - Batch CSV upload
- Automatic model and preprocessor loading from **Google Drive**.
- Integrated data preprocessing and derived feature generation pipeline

Note: The model file rf_model.pkl was too large to be hosted on Streamlit Cloud.
Since its size (~200 MB) exceeded GitHub’s 100 MB file limit, the model could not be committed to the repository.
Therefore, gdown was used to download the model dynamically from Google Drive at runtime.
